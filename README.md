# hello-world
A place where I store my ideas, resources, and share/discuss things with others

Hey, I'm Louis iaeger, a guy who wants to turn his and other peoples ideas into reality with the use of technology. I am teaching myself Git so that I can use it to collaborate with other developers on my future programming projects. :)

I am a 23 year-old graduate from Baylor University, and am married to a beautiful Aggie named Rachel.
